- 👋 Hi, Hola, I’m Gargeya Sharma, a Computer science Engineering Student in India
- 👀 I’m fanatic about Deep learning, along with that I love working with any kind of Data, just because I don't know anything about it, the mystery excites me in such a way that I wanna start communicating with data. Due to this, I am constantly amileorating my Data science skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Machine learning intergration with DevOps and Cloud**, to make fully functional Tier 2 ML Systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Science, Machine learning, Deep learing, Intergration of AI with Cloud.
- 📫 In case, you wish to reach me, contact me on: <br> gargeyablk16@gmail.com<br>[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gargeya-sharma-4159801a3/)

**More about me:**<br>
Above provided information is enough to get a gist about me but here I wanna tell you a little more about myself, because this is only way I can communicate with you for the first time. I like making myself clear and transparent.
I am an artist particularly in the field of Theatre, Acting in general along with Music and Dance. To stand on my feet before living my passion, I was advised to study engineering because I had Science, Maths with me in High school,
along with good IQ. I listened to the advice and get introduced with the whole new limitless world of computer science. 

I am a **Philomath** (loves any kind of learning) so I started understanding various technologies, amoung all the fields,
I fall in love with AI, to be more specific **Deep learning** and Neural Nets. Not just because they seems cools or something, in addition to being cool, I loved how they are at a very early stage trying to mimic the functioning of our brain. Now to be open about it,
I was always in love with **human psychology** in secret. So this technology, this field let me uncover that hidden love for psychology and gave me a *"will of fire"* you can say, *to make something extraordinary for this society using neural nets*. From that day onwards,
I have been studying AI *all day, all night* with such an exponential pace, passion and excitement that **I feel proud of my self** and I am planning to remain the same and live this newly found passion of mine to its completion before getting distracted by any other thing.
That was a small intro to **WHO I AM and HOW I STARTED DATA SCIENCE AND AI**.

Thank you for reading and letting me reach out to YOU.
